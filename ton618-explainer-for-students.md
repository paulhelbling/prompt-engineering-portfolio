# 🌌 TON 618 – Student-Level Explanation with Prompt Engineering

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project builds on the original TON 618 scientific explainer by using prompt engineering to **adapt tone, vocabulary, and structure** for a younger audience — specifically, 10th-grade students with an interest in science.

It demonstrates how language models can act as **educational tutors** when prompted with role-based and audience-specific instructions.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To apply the same core scientific content but:
- Simplify complex vocabulary
- Use analogies for understanding
- Keep the tone engaging and age-appropriate

---

## 💬 Prompt Example

> You are a science teacher explaining black holes to 10th grade students. Please explain what TON 618 is, why it’s so huge, and how scientists figured out its mass. Use simple words and give a size comparison that students can understand. Keep it under 300 words.

## 🧾 Sample Output (LLM-Generated)

**Response (as a science teacher):**

TON 618 is one of the biggest black holes we’ve ever found in space. It’s so huge that it's hard to even imagine — it’s about **66 billion times heavier than our Sun**!

A black hole is a place in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. TON 618 is far away — over **10 billion light-years from Earth** — but we can still study it because it shines very brightly as a quasar. That means a lot of gas and matter are spinning around it really fast and giving off energy before falling in.

Scientists don’t actually “see” the black hole itself, but they can measure the light from the spinning matter around it. The way the light behaves — how fast it's moving and how bright it is — tells scientists how massive the black hole must be.

To give you an idea of its size: if our **entire solar system** were a marble, then TON 618 would be a bowling ball that weighs as much as **10 galaxies** combined. It's *that* big.

TON 618 helps us learn how black holes grow and how the universe has changed over billions of years.
